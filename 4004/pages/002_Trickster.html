                <p>This section is composed of hidden monsters that could appear as us or our neighbours in our everyday lives and may even take the place of the ones we love or ourselves. These monsters love to confuse and to trick humans and much rather have humans tormented then to just feast on the humans. However, some classifications of these monsters are either unaware of these transformations, or do not control the transformation themselves. These monsters represent a fear of not knowing who are and what to trust.  They represent the deceptions of our own society and possibly the deceptions of nature itself. Stories of these shapeshifters describe how easily and how often it is that someone can get tricked into trusting or believing a shapeshifter or demon. The thing (1982) by John Carpenter showcases, the thing, a shapeshifting monster. This monster can take the form and shape of almost anyone and tries to be human but fails. This type of monster  creates a lack of trust in a community and makes those around the monster attempt to figure out who the real monster is, causing isolation, division and possibly aggression.</p>

                <h1>The Demon</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Demons are usually spiritual beings who are malevolent and have personalities. In the Christian religion, demons either trick humans or make them do immoral things in order to bring them to hell, both through manipulation and possession. They are in some cultures the epitome of evil. These beings can exist between the transcendent and temporal realms (<span class="italic">Angel and Demon</span>, n. d., para. 1). Demons are supernatural beings with a variety of powers and each demon usually has a name and a precise function. In the medieval times, The writers of <span class="italic">Ancient Origins</span> (2016) describe how in the medieval times, "people carried out rites of protection as it was believed that every individual was stalked by demons, who waited for a moment of weakness in order to strike".  There is an entire study dedicated to demons called Demonology who have researched a large volume of Christian demons, including Satan, to Ukobach. There are demons for each domain of activity and can be invoked for help in order to do better or succeed in that specific activity (<span class="italic">Ancient Demons...</span>, 2016, para. 2). However, there is always a price to this invocation, which usually involves the sould of a person who ends up in hell. Demons are also known to possess people and try to take over the bodies of humans in order to feast or torment on people. Jacques Collin de Plancy, created a dictionary of demons in his <span class="italic">Dictionnaire Infernal</span> (1862) classifying and discussing 69 different demons of hell. They are associated with Christian mythology and are often depicted as those that torture sinful people in hell. Demons can also be described as angelic beings who have fell from heaven as they were deceived by <span class="italic">Satan</span> (Chilton, 2016, para. 3).</p>
                <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
                <p>Demons tend to be humanoid in shape but can also take many forms. Some look monstrous or contain a variety of animal parts. They shift from animal to human in order to trick or stalk humans. Specific demons may have specific traits. For example, Satan can be seen as a demon with horns on his head in the form of a red dragon (Chilton, 2016, para. 3). The article, <span class="italic">The Changing Face of Satan, from 1500 to today </span>(2014), by Carey Dunne, describes how artists depicted Satan as a fanged, horned demon. Different pieces of different religions were synthesized, such as the cloven feet from Pan, the horns from the gods of various cults near the east of Germany, which started to personify evil (para. 3). However, Satan can take a variety of forms such as those of a clumsy child.</p>
                <h2>Behavioural Traits</h2>
                <p>Demons like to torment and to lie to humans. Demons are usually malicious but may rather have you cause harm to yourself then to harm you. Socrates referred to daimon as a spirit that inspires him to seek and speak the truth. Then demons became applied to "lesser spirits of the supernatural realm who exerted pressures on humans to perform actions that were not conducive to their well being" (para. 6). This has led to the common belief that demons cause malevolence and forbade evil, misfortune, and mischief.</p>
                <h2>Type</h2>
                <p>Demons all have names with traits and specific associations that can help people achieve certain wants and desires associated however, this costs your soul and can end in eternal punishment and death. Jacques Collin de Plancy wrote the book, <span class="italic">Dictionnaire Infernal</span>, in order to describe and classify a variety of demons of hell which are associated with Christian mythology.</p>
                <p>Christian demons refer to specific demons that are found in popular culture and have adapted a variety of aspects or traits through their use. These demons may encompass a few religions, such as Catholicism and Judaism, but mainly originate from a prolific work called the Bible. There are a variety of iterations of the bible and detail these demons through stories the interactions between people. </p>
                <p>Satan is the prince of evil spirits and the adversary of God (<span class="italic">Satan</span>, 2019, para. 1) . His alternative names are Lucifer and Belial. He was cast out of heaven as a fallen angel before the creation of humankind. Information on this fall is outlined in the bible, in the passages Ezekiel 28:14-18 and Isaiah 14:12-17. Satan is identified as the entity (that takes the form of a serpent) that tempts Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. <span class="italic">Satan</span> is the English translation of the Hebrew word "adversary" (2019, para. 2). Satan plays a large role in evil and essentially represents all evil deeds as he is the adversary of god, which is all good.</p>
                <p>Lilith is a female demonic figure from Jewish folklore whose name seems to come from the Mesopotamian demon called <span c;ass="italic">Lilu</span>, which usually translates as "night monster" (<span class="italic">Lilith</span>, n.d., para. 1). In Rabbinic literature, as describe by the article, <span class="italic">Lilith</span>, in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Lilith is said to have been depicted as the mother of Adam's demonic offspring after he separated from eve. Lilith is depicted as refusing to be subservient to Adam and left him and the Garden of Eden. In some other mythologies, her demonic offspring came from an archangel named Samael and were unrelated to Adam. These children are often identified as incubi and succubi (<span class="italic">Lilith</span>, n.d., para. 2).</p>
                <p>Some other examples and categories of demons include the <span class="italic">Sedim</span>. <span class="italic">Sedim </span>are demons who know no god and were not gods themselves. They are sacrificed to and can be read about in Deuteronomy 32:17-18 and Psalm 106:37 of the <span class="italic">bible</span> (Chilton, 2016, para. 5). <span class="italic">Rabisu</span> is a demon that instilled great fear into humans that <span class="italic">rabisu's</span> presence alone made humans terrified (<span class="italic">Angel and Demon</span>, 2019, para. 17). Some eastern demons include <span class="italic">Asuras</span>, <span class="italic">Nagas</span>, <span class="italic">Ahi</span>, and <span class="italic">Kamsa</span> in the religion of Hinduism. These demons apposed the gods and were hostile to humans and nature. These demons try to coerce people into performing foolish acts and attack saintly people (para. 18).  buddhists view demons as forces that stop humans from achieving nirvana. Some demons include <span class="italic">Mara</span>, <span class="italic">Rati</span>, <span class="italic">Raga</span>, and <span class="italic"></span>Tanha</span>, "which attempt to dissuade Siddharthat Gautama, the Buddha, from achieving his Enlightenment" (Angel and Demon, 2019, para. 18). The Chinese demons are called guei-shen who manifest in all aspects of nature, and are known to avoid light. Japanese demons describe mainly evil spirits who seek to possess and inflict harm on people. The <span class="italic">oni,</span> a powerful evil spirit, and the <span class="italic">tengu</span>, spirits that possess human beings, must be exorcised by priests (<span class="italic">Angel</span> and Demon, 2019, para. 18).</p>
                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>The term demon mainly comes from Christianity and western society. Demons can be found almost everywhere and transcend the physical world in the view of the Christian religion. Therefore they can be anywhere where humans are. Demons are often depicted as residing in hell which is almost like another dimension, of which the "bad" people who have died go to. </p>
                <h2>Origin & History</h2>
                <p>The term <span class="italic">demon</span> comes from the Greek word <span class="italic">daimon</span>, which means a "supernatural being" or "spirit" (<span class="italic">angel and demon</span>,  n. d., para. 2). Demons were originally described as "a spiritual being that influenced a person's character" which were later usually associated with an evil or malevolent spirit.  However, there are exceptions such as an <span class="italic">agathos daimon</span> who is a good spirit, and was benevolent in its relationship to humans. Many descriptions of demons and demonic deeds are found in the bible, and seem to have come from the Christian religion. The origins of the demons are not explicitly stated in the bible but these demons are always malevolent and serve the devil.</p>
                <p>"Demons have a very wide geographical and lengthy historical role as spiritual beings influencing humans in their relationship to the sacred or holy." as described in the article <span class="italic">Angel and Demon</span> (2019, para. 17). These demons may be semihuman, non human, or humanoid who attempt to lead humans astray from their path to attaining a higher spiritual state or to make humans perform activities that may impair their well being.</p>
                <h2>Symbolism</h2>
                <p>Demons were seen by early Christians as one of the main causes of diseases. Tertullian, the author of <span class="italic">Apologeticus </span>(22) wrote about how demons inflict" sickness and other grievous calamities upon our bodies."  Sarah Bond (2016) describes how demons were one way for early Christians to explain epilepsy and similar sicknesses (para. 3). They also used demons to explain dirty and dangerous thoughts that they may have had. Evagrius Ponticus, a monk who lived from 345 to 399 CE, proposed eight cardinal demonic thoughts which were then changed into seven deadly sins by monks such as John Cassian and Pope Gregory the Great (Bond, 2016, para. 2). Any bad thought seemed to indicate posession or connection to a demon and people needed to be constantly cleansed from this evil spirit. This cleansing is also called an 'exorcism', which is the act of removing the evil spirit from a possessed host. Exorcisms have been performed in Near Eastern Religious traditions, post-biblical Judaism and in early Christianity. Demons tend to be something that influences you in a malevolent way but cannot be scene and does not appear in reality. They infect peoples thoughts and cause them to do potentially immoral acts. </p>

                <h1>Werewolf or 'Were' animals</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Different variations of the werewolf or were, or "man," animals "can be found in both folklore and modern fiction and filmmaking" (p. 276). described in the <span class="italic">Encyclopedia of Monsters</span> (1982) written by Daniel Cohen. They are humans that transform or could transform themselves into animals, which is a belief that is very ancient and widespread. Werewolves shapeshift into a wolf either through magic, getting cursed or on purpose. Gervase of Tilbury in his <span class="italic">Otia Imperialia</span> (1214) was one of the first writer to associate the transformation of the werewolf with the full moon. Throughout the variety of stories, people become werewolves in many different ways. The article, <span class="italics">Werewolf legends</span> discusses how werewolves shape shifted dues to a curse, or an enchanted sash or cloak made of wolf pelts, while others transform from a scratch or a bite from a werewolf. The full moon may contribute to this transformation and cause humans to temporarily turn into beasts. Australia's Calvary Mater Newcastle hospital (Calver et al., 2009) conducted a study where it was found that "violent and acute behavioral disturbance manifested more commonly during the full moon (p. 1). This study helps explain why beastiality and werewolves may be associated with the full moon. People tend to be more violent and beast like at this time.</p>
                <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
                <p>A Werewolf appears human until they transform into a wolf. Usually the wolf is larger and more menacing then normal wolves and often have similar features or traits of the human form they were previously. Werewolves tend to be very strong with sharp fangs, claws and teeth. Their physical distinction is in the fact that they can change between animal and human. Many werewolf stories depict the body of the wolf to be quite humanoid in appearance.</p>
                <h2>Behavioural Traits</h2>
                <p>For the most part, werewolf's appear human and display normal human traits. However, either when triggered or when they transform into an animal, they start to behave like an animal or with animalistic traits. Usually, these animals tend to be predatory and involve the harm and hunger for other people. In most cases, werewolf try not to be intentionally deceptive and malicious towards other people but in some stories, the werewolf is not aware that they transform or have memories from their transformations. In a lot of media and literature, such as What we do in the shadows (2014), the werewolves do not have control over their transformation and their actions during the transformation. They are inclined to attack anyone and everyone who provokes them or who looks like prey when they transform into an animal. Unlike real wolves, werewolves tend to be singular instances and therefore do not usually join together and form packs.</p>
                <h2>Location & Types</h2>
                <p>Were-animals are found all around the world. More specifically, werewolves can be found all across Europe.  Ellie Crystal on her article Werewolf (2017) desribes how "many European countries and cultures have stories of werewolves, including France (loup-garou), Greece (lycanthropos), Spain (hombre lobo), Bulgaria (varkolak, vulkodlak), Czech Republic (vlkodlak), Serbia (vukodlak), Russia (oboroten', vurdalak), Ukraine (vovkulak, vovkun, pereverten'), Croatia (vukodlak), Poland (wilkolak), Romania (varcolac), Scotland (werewolf, wulver), England (werwolf), Ireland (faoladh or conriocht), Germany (Werwolf), Denmark/Sweden (Varulv), Galicia(lobisun), Portugal (lobisomem) Lithuania (vilkolakis and vilkatlakis), Latvia (vilkatis and vilkacis), Andorra (home llop), Estonia (libahunt), Argentina (lobizon, hombre lobo) and Italy (lupo mannaro)." The type or the name of the werewolf changes depending on its location but in the most cases, these werewolves have the same function and the same basic traits.</p>
                <h2>Origin & History</h2>
                <p>Tanika Koosmen describes how one of the earliest surviving example of man-to-wolf transformation in *The Epic of Gilgamesh* (2,100 BCE) (2018, para. 2). Gilgamesh rejected a lover because "she had turned her previous mate into a wolf (<span class="italic">Werewolf Legends,</span> 2017, para. 2). In Greek Mythology, the <span class="italic">Lycaon</span> story is one of the earliest werewolf legends. A version of the story describes how Lycaon, son of Pelasgus, angered the god of Zeus when Lycaon served him a meal made of a sacrificed boy. Lycaon and all of his sons were transformed into wolves (para. 3). A Roman werewolf story describes how a man was selected to swim across a lake in Arcadia where he was transformed into a wolf for nine years (Crystal, 2017, para. 9) and if they did not harm a human being then they can return to being human. In Latvian mythology, the Vilkacis is a human that changed into a wolf-like monster who were more often beneficial than terrifying (Crystal, 2017, para. 5). Herodotus describes how the people of Neuri, a tribe in the north-east of Scythia, annually transformed for a few days into wolves (Crystal, 2017, para. 10). In <span class="italic">Satyricon</span> (60), Gaius Petronius, recites a story about a man who turns into a wolf during the full moon (Crystal, 2017, para. 10). "The werewolf as we now know it first appeared in ancient Greece and Rome, in ethnographic, poetic and philosophical texts" (Koosmen, 2018, para. 2). In his book, <span class="italic">The Encyclopedia of Monsters</span>  (1982), Daniel Cohen describes how "an early cave drawing shows a human figure, apparently a sorcerer, wearing the skin of a deer. This is one of the very few human figures ever to appear in cave art" (p. 276). Cohen describes how the shaman or sorcerer will put on the skin of the animal that they are currently hunting. This establishes some kind of power over the animal being hunted, where the shaman has some control over the animals movements and guides the animal to the hunters spear or trap (p. 276). In certain societies, clans or tribes possess at totemic animal of which they are believed to be a descendant of or some how forma special relationship with this animal (p. 276). Tribesman may put on certain costumes to look like the totem and may act like the animal. Ellie Crystal (2017) describes how there are also Armenian beliefs of women who commit deadly sins that are condemned to seven years in the form of a wolf, who consequently devour their children, and those of different relationships branching out until she devours the children's of strangers. These werewolves only transform at night and become human during the day, were some believe that this transformation is involuntary and others believe that the human beings can change themselves in and out of animal forms at will (Crystal, 2017, para. 11).</p>
                <p>Ancient Norsemen acted as berserkers, who would wear the pelts of bears, not only for the warmth and appearance, but also for the courage and strength of a bear (p. 276 - 277). Berserkers were the  most feared fighters who felt no pain  and would fight with no restraint and with tremendous strength, whether it be friend or foe. This created the word <span class="italic">berserk</span> which "describes anyone who is violently insane and imagines himself to be a wild animal" (p. 277). </p>
                <p>Ellie Crystal describes how France seemed to have many werewolves in the 16th century, with a variety of trials such as those of the Gandillon family in the Jura, and the Roulet family in Angers, which occured in the year 1598 (2017, para. 12). These werewolves may have been caused by Ergot, a fungus that grows in rye grains usually during wet seasons after very cold winters. Ergot causes hallucinations, mass hysteria, paranoia, and, more severely, convulsions and death, which can be spread throughout the entire town. This poisoning may have cause the hallucinations of people turning into wolves or may be the cause of people turning animalistic, attacking each other or even dying, creating a belief that witnesses may have seen a werewolf attack. Another example includes how in 1521, Pierre Burgot and Michel Verdun turned themselves into wolves and brutally murdered several children (Werewolf legends, 2017, para. 5). This was possibly caused by Ergot or even mental illness, but contributed to the modern superstition of werewolves. </p>
                <h2>Symbolism</h2>
                <p>Werewolves and similar were-people were always a concern throughout the history of humanity as we are and originate from societies of hunters and predators. Werewolves describe our connection to an animalistic and beastly nature. There is a beast within us. Usually this beast has a hunger for devouring someone. This beast also hides in plain site, by appearing and acting human in every day life, while the beast appears either at night or during the full moon. There are a variety of medical condition that contributed to werewolf mania which includes lyconthropy, food piosoning, hyperthrichosis, rabies, and hallucinations as described in <span class="italic">Werewolf Legends</span> (2017, para. 17). Werewolf also establishes a link between behaviour and biology, discussing how turning into a more animalistic form makes the human more savage and malicious. Werewolves tend to be associated with bloodlust and immorality. For example in the 16th century, the death and brutal murder of children were carried out by Pierre Burgot and Michel Verdun who experienced lycanthropy. Lyncanthropy is apparent in one of the main villains of the game <span class="italic">>Observer_</span> (2017) created by the Bloober Team. However, recently, the werewolf has been seen as a humanity that is more closely associated with nature, due to the rise of environmentalism. Werewolves may have also been used to explain the behavioral phenomenon of wanting to devour and murder humans, similar to the stories of the wendigo. </p>
