                <p>This is a story of overpowering hunger. These monsters want to feast above anything else. They either enjoy devouring humans or have a constant urge to do so. A monster may act with willingness towards gluttony and greed but some value gluttony above even their own safety or well being. However, this hunger isn't just limited to consumption.  There are also those with the need to kill and to harm. Beasts and large animals often represent this fear of this malicious gluttony and have been known to terrorize many towns across the world throughout the dawn of civilization. These beasts have been said to terrorize humans and feast on them in ways that cause suffering and terror.</p>

                <h1>the Wendigo</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>In the article, Wendigo, written by Steve Pitt for the Canadian encyclopedia, "A wendigo is a supernatural being belonging to the spiritual traditions of Algonquian-speaking First Nations in North America" (Pitt, 2012, par. 1). He describes how most Algonquian oral traditional stories describe it as a cannibalistic monster which preys on the weak and socially disconnected. Wendigos are thought of by many aboriginal cultures to be a real creature and the site, All That's Interesting states how "the Algonquian tribes blamed many unsolved disappearances of people on wendigo attacks" (*The Native American Legend Of The Wendigo*, 2019, par. 3) in the 20th century. Wendigo's have many variations of spelling, depending on the different First Nations that speak it. These nations include the Abenaki, SIksika, Mi'kmaq, Algonquin, Ojibwe and Innu, listed by Pitt (2012, par. 3). He continuous to list the various spellings, including <span class="italic">wendigo</span>, <span class="italic">wheetigo</span>, <span class="italic">windikook</span>, <span class="italic">wi'ntsigo</span>, <span class="italic">wi'tigo</span>, <span class="italic">wittikka</span> and <span class="italic">windigo</span> (2012, par. 3). These terms all represent the same creature and are used throughout a variety of algonquin cultures. Some articles indicate how wendigos can possess people into doing their bidding or those who have succumb to greed or gluttony (<span class="italic">Wendigo</span>, n.d., par. 4).</p>
                <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
                <p>The wendigo is in the form of a human who has been overcome by hunger. The wendigo is thought to be quite large, almost fifteen feet tall, but not overly muscular (*The Native American Legend*, 2019, par. 3). The wendigo usually appears sickly or emaciated potentially because the wendigo is never satisfied and always wanting another victim, as described by the same source (2019, par. 4). According to the *Legends of the Nahanni Valley,* Basil H. Johnston describes the wendigo as a point of emaciation with "desiccated skin pulled tightly over its bones" (T*he Native American Legend*, 2019, par 6). "Bones [pushed] out over its skin, its complexion the ash gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into the sockets, the Wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave " (T*he Native American Legend...*, 2019, par 6). Johnston is a native author and ethnographer and he continues to discuss how "the wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption." This article also indicates how some other traits are thought to be large sharp claws and massive eyes like an owl (2019, par. 7).  The *Wendigo* article written in *Legends of America* describes how wendigos can have glowing eyes, long yellowed fangs, terrible claws, and overly long tongues (*Wendigo,* n.d., par. 5). Furthermore, in the same article, they are depicted as covered in hair or with yellowish skin.</p>
                <h2>Behavioural Traits</h2>
                <p>Pitt continues to describe how Wendigo's have the desire to kill and eat their victims (2012, par. 1). It is possible to become a wendigo as a human from greed or weakness of heart. Anyone can become a wendigo, which is a form of losing humanity. Humans transform into wendigos from greed or weakness and therefore wendigoes have a strong desire to kill and eat others. Wendigoes also have great hunting and predatory abilities, as they come from hunters. From the article <span class="italic">The Wendigo: A Terrifying Beast With an Insatiable Hunger for <span class="italic">Human Flesh</span> (2016), the author describes how the wendigo remains hungry no matter how much flesh they eat (par. 2). </p>
                <p>Wendigo Psychosis, in western medical vocabulary refers to patients who felt possessed by cannibalistic desires. The Wendigo article of the Canadian Encyclopedia, describes how wendigo psychosis was first used by Missionary J. E. Saindon in the 1920s working in the Cree community in the wester James Bay area. He encountered a women (Pitt, 2012, par. 9) who described how strangers wanted to kill and devour her. Pitt however, expressed doubt if this affliction is real or just perceived by the victim. In Legends of America, the article indicates how the wendigo psychosis usually occurs around the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States, around the winter time "in individuals who are isolated by heavy snow fall for long periods of time" (<span class="italic">Wendigo</span>, n.d., par. 6).</p>
                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>Depending on what source you get your information from the appearance of the Wendigo is different. Wendigos tend to be cold weather creatures, and are mainly found in Canada and northern American states such as Minnesota, as indicated by the website All That's Interesting (The Native American Legend, 2019, par. 3). He adds on to how, wendigos are believed to roam around the forests near Algonquian villages and the disappearances of actual forest dwellers are thought to be from wendigo attacks. </p>
                <h2>Origin & History</h2>
                <p>Pitt describes the origin from Algonquin oral history for many centuries (Pitt, 2012, par. 7). before the European colonization. The first written account of the wendigo by a European was in the 17th century by Paul Le Jeune, a Jesuit missionary. He lived with the Algonquin people in what is now Quebec. Paul Le Jeune is quoted to have written that "this devilish woman…added that [the windigo] had eaten some Attikamegoukin — these are the tribes that live north of the River that is called Three Rivers — and that he would eat a great many more of them if he were not called elsewhere. But that Atchen (sort of a werewolf) would come in his place to devour them… even up to the French Fort; that he would slaughter the French themselves" (Pitt, 2012, par. 8). This fear of this evil spirit apparent in even those outside First Nations. Wendigos were also said to have taken on personalities of members of a victim in a travelling group and then proceeded to kill every other human encountered (Pitt, 2012, par. 9).</p>
                <p>In the website, Legends of America, the creature is described by the Algonquian legend as "a giant with a heart of ice; sometimes it is thought to be entirely made of ice. Its body is skeletal and deformed, with missing lips and toes." (<span class="italic">Wendigo</span>, n.d., par. 2). Furthermore, the Ojibwa describe it as how:</p>
                <p class="citation">"It was a large creature, as tall as a tree, with a lipless mouth and jagged teeth. Its breath was a strange hiss, its footprints full of blood, and it ate any man, woman or child who ventured into its territory. And those were the lucky ones. Sometimes, the Wendigo chose to possess a person instead, and then the luckless individual became a Wendigo himself, hunting down those he had once loved and feasting upon their flesh." (<span class="italic">Wendigo, n.d., par. 2).</p>
                <p class="citation">"It was a large creature, as tall as a tree, with a lipless mouth and jagged teeth.

Sometimes, the Wendigo chose to possess a person instead, and then the luckless individual became a Wendigo himself, hunting down those he had once loved and feasting upon their flesh." (<span class="italic">Wendigo, n.d., par. 2).</p>
                <p>In the past many aboriginal settlers became stranded in harsh winter forests of the north which led to possibly cannibalism and this psychosis with delusions of being transformed into a wendigo monster, possibly seeing others as edible but also fear becoming a cannibal. Some articles, including Ancient-origins, believe that wendigo's are formed from whenever a human resorted to cannibalism.  Wendigos seem to have been sighted mainly between the 1800s and 1920s as indicated by All That's Interesting (The Native American, 2019 para. 23) near the town Roseau in northern Minnesota (<span class="italic">The Wendigo</span>, 2016, par. 9)</p>
                <h2>Symbolism</h2>
                <p>The story of the wendigo demonstrates aspects of culture, belief, lifestyle and traditions of the people that tell these legends and emphasize dos and do nots in society. Wendigos can serve as a warning or an omen, dictating what not to do or what values to uphold in order to avoid becoming a wendigo. Pitt further describes the conditions of creating a wendigo as ever present in the First Nations communities living in colder areas such as the northern boreal forest (Pitt, 2012, par. 10). Wendigos also often represented greed and individualism and were tales to encourage sharing and a communal attitude of both food and possessions (Pitt, 2012, par. 11). All That's Interesting explains how the wendigo also describes the act of greed, selfishness and violence as taboo, calling people that partake in it, monsters (*The Native American Legend,* 2019, par. 16). The wendigo is a symbol of excess, and this idea of "turning wendigo" can happen to anyone as a way to describe straying from the community for selfishness or greed. A lot of wendigo stories are attributed to the stress of native communities where tension can build up and accusations can be made that may cause divide between the community, as anyone can be possessed by the Wendigo. The stress usually comes from dwindling resources and the lack of food in the area, which leads to fears of starvation, a feeling that can potentially lead to people turning Wendigo.</p>
                <p>For some indigenous persons, the wendigo represents the forces of colonization and injustices that are encountered by the Indigenous people (Pitt, 2012, par. 13). Armand Ruffo's film, *A Windigo Tale (2012)* uses a wendigo as an analogy to discuss stories of intergenerational trauma of residential schools, and the impacts of the Indian Act, the Sixties Scoop, and assimilative policies (Pitt, 2012, par.12). The Wendigo is now a metaphor for any culture or person consumed by greed and represents a strong struggle with ones own appetite.</p>

                <h1>Zombie</h1>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A reawaked corpse with a ravenous appetite or someone bitten by another zombie infected with a zombie virus. A zombie is a human turned mindless and cannibalistic. Zombies are usually very dangerous and are depicted in apocalyptic environments. They tend to be spread by disease or through bites very quickly. This description of zombies lends to some versatility in methods of zombie traits and zombie creation allowing for a variety of themes to be demonstrated through zombies. Usually the writers or directors of a series design their own traits and aspects of the zombie horde in order to fit their story telling needs. Zombies are in most cases not alien or not as different looking then the people around them. The process of decaying flesh on zombies is significantly sped up in order to make a physical and visible distinction between a "turned" versus an "unturned" zombie. However, zombies can and a lot of the times look just like anyone else. These zombies become unrecognizable in behavior alone which adds to the terror of zombies. The turned become stuck in a state of incoherent violence that aim to harm and attack anyone and everyone even those that they have had intimate and friendly relationships with before turning into a zombie.</p>
                <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
                <p>The editors of History.com (2017) describes zombies as strong and robotic with rotting flesh (para. 3). They want to feed and tend not to speak accept for grunting and moaning. These zombies may sometimes be much stronger than a normal human, such as <span class="italic">Necromorphs</span>, but most of the time are usually strong because they have no concern for their own physical limitations and exert more than what is maintainable. Sometimes they can run and go really fast beyond their physical limitations but in a lot of cases, they walk. Zombies from the animated television series <span class="italic"></span>Kabeneri of the Iron Fortress</span> (2016) directed by Tetsuro Araki contains zombies of super human strength that sometimes clump together into a much larger zombies. These zombies appear burnt and ashy with bright orange lines of light running through them, and a glowing heart protected by iron.</p>
                <h2>Behavioural Traits</h2>
                <p>Usually mindless and usually are unable to think besides the want to eat human flesh. A lot of comical depictions of zombies see them as wanting to specifically eat human brains. Zombies tend to not have concern for their own bodies or their own physical limitations and would break or maim themselves in order to feast. Zombies tend to be extremely aggressive in behavior and seek to attack any living thing. Zombies are known for hording and tend to not attack each other. Once the human that zombies are feasting on turn into a zombie, zombies tend to be depicted as losing interest and start to look for another target. People who are turning into a zombie vary in the amount of time it takes for them to completely lose their mind. Some people turn in a matter of minutes while others take days to turn. The process usually is displayed both physically and behaviorally as a gradual descent into animalistic behavior.</p>
                <h2>Types</h2>
                <p>Zombies takes many form depending on the story and universe they are portrayed in and can have a variety of traits. In the Walking Dead a graphic novel created by Robert Kirkman, zombies cannot run and are a bit slower than most people, yet they still do have strong bites. In World War Z, a film by Mark Foster, the zombies run much faster than a normal human being and horde together and climb on top of each other in order to scale walls and buildings. The editors of History.com (2017) describe how the voodoo zombie, originating in the most part from West Africa and practiced through Haiti and the Caribbean, Brazil, the American South, and other African heritage places (para. 6) which displays the zombies as basically a soulless slave used to be controlled and would have a zombie master dictating their every move. These zombies originated from the voodoo religion and the people who revive these zombies are known as <span class="italic">bokor</span> (para. 7). They use a concoction known as zombie powder. Another article includes how the Baron Samedi, the lord of the cemetery, is the one that can help transport people to <span class="italic">lan guinee</span> (Wilentz, 21012, para. 6). There are other subsidiaries of zombies such as <span class="italic">Necromorphs</span> which are more so an alien species of the video game Dead Space (2008), however they share many of the same traits and features as zombies. They are the reanimated dead and seek to attack and feast on human flesh. However, what's different is that they are reshaped corpses from an extraterrestrial infection. The Infected, in the Last of Us (2013), were an outbreak that derived from Cordyceps, a fungus which transforms human hosts into aggressive creatures, eventually turning them into immobile corpses that spread spores and infects anyone that breathes in the spores. These are a couple of examples of the diversity and range of what a zombie can do and what a zombie can originate from.</p>
                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>Zombies tend to be found in an apocalyptic environment and can usually take place in almost anywhere during anytime period. There is a Korean Netflix series called <span class="italic">Kingdom</span> where zombies start to appear in the Josean Period of Korea, which is right after the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592-1598). Many other movies have the zombie pandemic spread throughout the entire world, decimating the human race and lending only smaller post-apocalyptic communities to survival. </p>
                <h2>Origin & History</h2>
                <p>Ancient Greek had a fear of zombies (history.com, 2017, para. 4). Rossella Lorenzi expands on this origin as how some bodies in burial grounds were pined down. The Greeks believed in a Ghostly version of the dead who rise from the graves and stalk the living (Lorenzi, 2015, para. 1). A variety of bodies were buried with objects pinning them down. However, "it is unknown why the occupants of those burials were pinned in their graves" but this may be due to necrophobic beliefs and practices of the Greeks at the time.</p>
                <p>Amy Wilentz discusses the origins of the zombie creature in her article <span class="italic">A Zombie is a Slave Forever</span> (2012). Zombies arose from a "mixture of old African religious beliefs and the pain of slavery" (para. 2) most notably in the era of French colonialization of Haiti, which was cold blooded and merciless. A zombie originated from slavery but similar African tales may have come from the ritual of moving a dying soul into a bottle for later use (para. 2). Life was extremely brutal as a slave in the 17th and 18th century of Haiti where they experience hunger, cruelty and extreme overwork. Children, in the eyes of plantation owners, were seen as a waste of resources and were not valuable to the slave owners as more laborer's could be imported. The only escape from these harsh plantations was death which was also seen as going back to Africa, or "lan guinee" (Guinea or West Africa). Lan guinee is a phrase in Haitian Creole that still means heaven. Plantation meant a life of servitude while lan guinee meant freedom (para. 4). Slaves often committed suicide but the fear of turning into a zombie prevented many of them from doing so. A zombie, in this perspective, is a dead person who cannot go to <span class="italic">lan guinee</span>. To be dead and still a slave (para. 5) is to be a zombie.</p>
                <p>Peter Dendle, in his book, <span class="italic">The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000-2010 </span>(2012) describes how the seeming lifespan of zombies as a cinematic creature spanned from 1932 to 1989. However, zombie movies came back on screen in the 2000s. The zombie is able to communicate a variety of exciting genres, such as action, romance and horror. Dendle reminisces about the earliest zombie movies between 1932 to 1952 (p. 3) in his previous book, <span class="italic">The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia</span> (2001). These early film zombies are robotic and have constant unwavering pace and fluid motion, walking in sync and talk in a monotone voice. They demonstrate no passion or drive, unlike recent animalistic zombies (p. 3). These early zombies displayed the theme of control over the female mind and body, along with the theme of racial tension. The film <span class="italic">Ouanga</span> (1935) directed by George Terwillinger is blatently racist with its portrayal of natives as monsters, and plays on the symbolism of black as evil and white as light and purity (Dendle, 2001, p. 3). The film, <span class="italic">I Walked with a Zombie</span> (1943), is not as racialized as the previous movies. </p>
                <h2>Symbolism</h2>
                <p>Terrifyingly anyone can turn into a zombie. accept for those with supposed immunity. This can represent a fear of losing your ability to understand or the fear that those around us can become aggressive at any moment. Liz Cole, in the article <span class="italic">Zombies</span> (2005) discusses how zombies can be used to discuss and criticize a variety of social ills, such as "government ineptitude, the fear of bio-engineering, slavery, greed and exploitation" (para. 1). The zombie virus as it is a virus always originates somewhere and continues to spread throughout a series, infecting more people and usually destroying entire communities or cities, possibly causing a <span class="italic">zombie apocalypse</span> across an entire country or throughout the entire world. Zombies in this sense can represent how a small mistake or a small idea can spread throughout the entire world. This looks more towards the pathogenic side of the zombies and explores them as a spreading of violence and disease. This can also be a response to the ever pressing interconnectedness and globalization of all of our communities. This can demonstrate a possible fear or consequence of being "too connected" where if one community gets infected, then it will quickly and easily spread across to many other communities. Zombies have become extremely popular and relevant as they are easily malleable and can represent a variety of themes that may plague the human societies that watch it. Zombies are not just found as horrifying monsters but can appear in satirical pieces and comedies such as <span class="italic">Shaun of the Dead</span> (2004) and <span class="italic">Zombieland</span> (2009). These iterations of the zombie genre, demonstrates and explores new kinds of society, ones that are plagued with the quick and sudden loss of certain personal connections of the community. When someone turns into a zombie, then you instantly turn from friend to enemy. After World War II, with the idea of atomic warfare and the xenophobia caused by the Cold wars, zombies became a part of science fiction. including <span class="italic">Creature with the Atomic Brain</span> (1955). Zombies are not the only threat in a zombie ridden environment. Zombies end up being the secondary threat to the other humans that seek to look out for themselves or their own self preservation. Humans become the real monsters in zombie ridden environments and are usually the main threat in zombie media and films, such as <span class="italic">The Walking Dead</span> (2003) and <span class="italic">The Last of Us</span> (2013).</p>
                <p>Stephen Harper discusses the symbolism of consumerism, represented in George Romero's Dawn of the Dead in the article "Zombies, Malls, and the Consumerism Debate: George Romero's Dawn of the Dead". A shopping mall is the setting and battleground of the story where four human survivors exterminate the zombies in the mall and are then confronted by a gang of marauding bikers who aim to take over the mall. As Harper sees it, these occurrences can be seen as "metaphor for recent theoretical disputes over the nature and value of consumerism" (para. 1).  Harper addresses the two competing views of consumerism demonstrated through <span class="italic"> Dawn of the Dead</span>. The first, being a Marxist critique of the harmful effects of capitalist production on the exploits and depoliticizing effects of commodity fetishism on consumers (para. 2). The other side describes how consumerism empowers the capitalist subjects with a limited but politically important space in which subjects can partake in "utopian fantasies of autonomy" (para. 2). In Romero's <span class="italic">Dawn of the Dead</span>, zombies function as a symbol of an oppressed group. Zombies in the cinema of the early twentieth century are synonymous with oppression and slavery. The humans of these films are "living over" the zombies of the film, whereas Captain Rhodes sees the zombies as disposable and despicable underclass. As seen from the SWAT raid, the second scene in the film, demonstrates the racial oppression and social abjection associated with the zombie plague (para. 6). </p>
                <p>Dendle in his book, <span class="italic">The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia</span>, he discusses how early zombie films, between the year 1932 and 1952, are concerned with "the appropriation of the female bodies, and the annihilation of female minds, by male captors" (p. 3). Villains learn to possess a woman's mindless body. Underneath this concern is the theme of racial tension. For example, *White Zombie* (1932), directed by Victor Halperin, is about the villain hypnotizing a white women, in contrast to the native dead of the main villain, Legendre's, zombie army.</p>
                <p>Zombies represent a variety of fears and as they are not just a single individual monster, but a hoard, zombies can appear anywhere and in any place and as anyone. This fear of others is greatly represented in zombie media, where a lot of the characters tend to just stick to themselves or their own communities with those that try to help others or help too many end up attacked or dead by either the zombies or other humans.</p>
