                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The word <span class="italic">Monster</span> is a flexible term that can be applied to a variety of different contexts and situations. I will be looking specifically at monsters as a cultural phenomenon that embodies the fears and norms of people and society. I will not be looking at the use of *Monster* as a way of describing human beings or races or as a derogatory term. Monsters have grown with us throughout the years of our civilization and have shaped and have been shaped by our opinions and perceptions of the world around us. Through this collection, I will explore monsters as a tool for understanding societal norms and fears found in different communities and cultures.</p>
                <p>These monsters will be sorted into types by my understanding of some key values that they represent in order to simplify a method to classify and understand these monsters. Not every iteration and interpretation of the monster mentioned will fit exactly into each category and are limited to the category described, due to the fact that monsters across different cultures can represent different values. A lot of these monsters come from media and possibly hoaxes which is just as valuable as literary and folkloric monsters as they have, in part, influenced the cultures that we live in. This is by far not a complete list but will be a look at just a couple of monsters and what defines them as monsters and what sets them apart from each other. I have selected each monster because they garner a lot of terror and attention and seem to be very intriguing in their rejection of norms and society. They may not be the most popular but are nonetheless important to me personally. My aim is to eventually develop my own monsters using this research to fill in an appropriate methodology of how to build a monster. Due to the nature of monsters being built off of perception or public opinion, the research will not only be from scholarly sources but from news articles and similar formats that may not be perfectly accurate.</p>
