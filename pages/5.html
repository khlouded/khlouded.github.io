                <h1>Design Considerations</h1>
                <p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a usable structure before moving on to sketches. I went through a variety of iterations of how the structure of the content would be organized and what would make the most sense. Initially, I drew a lot of information from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-run-club/id387771637"> Nike Run Club App</a> and the <a href="https://www.withings.com/ca/en/health-mate" >Nokia Healthmate App</a>. I shifted the focus on the lessons, emphasizing components that promote improvement and learning. These elements include personalized tips and data driven recommendations. This device is speculative and will be able to record a multitude of performance data which can be analyzed in order to improve and micromanage the boarders skills. I have experience teaching snowboarding and can draw from the resources I have collected from trainings.</p>

                <h3>User 01 Alexi Romovik</h3>
                <p>Alexi is a Beginner Snowboarder who is 42 years old. She wants to learn snowboarding as her kids are currently learning as well but never got the chance. She has no experience skiing and her children are starting to want to go to larger mountains. She wants to do it with them to make sure they are safe and she wanted to find a way to learn without burdening anyone or embarrassing herself with an instructor.</p>

                <p>A first time user will go through instructions on how to use the main components as it is important to know how to interact with it as AR is new and currently unintuitive.</p>

                <p>The Bottom Bar contains the Statistics, Media, Lesson Browser, Community, Device. The Top Bar on the main pages contains the Profile and an Action button depending on the page. Each section can be swiped left or right and would contains sub sections inside of them. This style of navigation is simple to the Nike Run App and is a method of organizing a large amount of content of different sections that seems effective.</p>
