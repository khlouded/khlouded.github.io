                <h1>Design Considerations</h1>
                <p>I spent a lot of time trying to figure out a usable structure before moving on to sketches. I went through a variety of iterations of how the structure of the content would be organized and what would make the most sense. Initially, I drew a lot of information from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nike-run-club/id387771637"> Nike Run Club App</a> and the <a href="https://www.withings.com/ca/en/health-mate" >Nokia Healthmate App</a>. I shifted the focus on the lessons, emphasizing components that promote improvement and learning. These elements include personalized tips and data driven recommendations. This device is speculative and will be able to record a multitude of performance data which can be analyzed in order to improve and micromanage the boarders skills. I have experience teaching snowboarding and can draw from the resources I have collected from trainings. However, beyond this there would be social interactions that include competitive routes and the ability to set your own routes. The device will track the information using stickers attached to the board or stickers on the board, or the board with all of the tracking ability can be purchased as well.</p>

                <h3>Points</h3>
                <p>Points are based on a variety of things. The 'turn' quality calculator, combo and trick counter, distance, speed and # of falls are some elements that influence the amount of points a user would have. All of these points are counted together in a normal run. However, in a race, a specific point counter can be used to judge score, As some races are specifically for tricks. There are three types of races, Speed races, Trick races. Each race counts a specific counter and multiplies it by the race multiplier</p>

                <h1>AR Device Architecture</h1>
                <h3>Welcome Screen</h3>
                <p>A screen showing the general location and the weather conditions and snow conditions. This would be like a good morning, and would only appear at the beginning of a session or when you move to a new location. At the top of the hill, the name of the run will appear in AR.</p>
                <h3>Syncing and Callibration</h3>
                <p>The sync screen will only show up the first time you connect to a device. When using the device later on, it will sync passively with the phone using bluetooth. Callibration will happen everytime you open the app.</p>
                <h3>Physical Buttons</h3>
                <p>The action button is the main physical control of the device. While the board is still will have different effects then when moving. While moving, tap once to take a photo and double tap to start recording. Hold to turn off the UI. While still, hold to access the menu to change modes and access the power options. When accessing the lesson mode, the lesson browser would pop up, and only the lessons in your skill level would be available. Holding the volume buttons at the same time will mute or unmute the audio.</p>    
                <h3>Interactions</h3>
                <p>Your hands are used to interact with the buttons on the screen. Turning your hand presses the button. The cursor at the center of the goggles can also be used to send messages to specific people or to view certain information.</p>
                <p>A user can do all of the same interactions through voice. Through voice, you can also answer calls, send messages, and notify the group of members you may be travelling with. The keyword is Beyond Snowgear.</p>
                <h3>Sending and Recieving Messages</h3>
                <p>A user can get or recieve messages. This can be to other users around you or to people in your phone contacts. You can also voice chat or communicate with either people around you or a select group of people. This is done by hovering the cursor over someone or saying their name after triggering the keywords. </p>
                <h3>Main UI</h3>
                <p>Contains speed, time, and location that will always be available. The sync, callibration, volume, and biometrics will only show information when required. Changing information is done through the app. All modes include safety features, such as danger detection and low visibility.</p>s
                <h3>Challenge Mode</h3>
                <p>This mode appears when accepting a challenge, event or a race. On regular mountains, you can enter into a challenge route in order to compare and compete with others. However if you make a new path, find new terrain or enter a new unexplored area, at the ending summary, the device will ask if you want to set a challenge. After accepting, you pick the type of challenge and Looking up at the mountain the ending marker will slide on the route you have taken in order to set the finish line. This allows for the end of the race to be where the boarder was at max speed. </p>
                <h3>Object Detection: Tricks and Features</h3>
                <p>Dangers such as objects and ice sheets will be highlighted with minimal UI. However, if a user interacts with it, it will become feature.</p>

                <h3>Instructor Mode</h3>
                <p>This is done by picking a lesson in the lesson browser and is only available when doing a lesson. </p>

                <h3>Camera</h3>
                <h3>Low Visibility</h3>
                <p>Wipe the screen to enter low visibility mode. Low visibility mode is automatic on sections that have difficult visibility and isn't overly intrusive with some outline of irregular surfaces or edges of jumps or clifs.</p>
                

                <h1>Phone Architecture</h1>
                <p>The purpose of the phone is to provide opportunity for more detailed and analytical review and improvement, as well as connecting people together. </p>
                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>The Bottom Bar contains the Statistics, Media, Lesson Browser, Community, Device. The Top Bar on the main pages contains the Profile and an Action button depending on the page. Each section can be swiped left or right and would contains sub sections inside of them. This style of navigation is simple to the Nike Run App and is a method of organizing a large amount of content of different sections that seems effective.</p>
                <h3>Statistics</h3>
                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>This section gives some overall statistics of the users information. This section can be accessed and clicked on for more detailed statistics</p>
                <p>The main information given is Total Distance, Total # of Runs</p>
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>Runs will be different colours depending on the three modes, default, focus, and lessons. Runs will be grouped by session and location. The run information will show the distance, total points, date, time, and location. There would be a graphic depicting a general outline of the run.</p>
                <h4>Individual Runs Details</h4>
                <p>This page would showcase that specific run and any data that a user may possibly need. There would be a video or run walkthrough section, allowing the user to scroll through the run, looking through various data points in a timeline about the run.</p>
                <p>A user will also have access to summary information and a </p>
