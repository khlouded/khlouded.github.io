                <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
                <p>I did not have enough screens for the AR section of the marketing website and therefore I focused on the phone app screens instead as a companion app that allows you to control the aforementioned AR devices. I took a lot of inspiration from the Nike Run App, as the nike website has a lot of products and a seperate companion app page that you can tag shoes and still control some of their products. These websites really gave a sporty impression and I wanted to capture something similar in my app marketing site.</p>

                <h3>Journal</h3>
                <p>This week was spent mainly hand coding. For the icons and graphics, I took them from websites that had them, such as the Uber website, and the various ski resort locations. For the photography, I took them mainly from unsplashed.</p>
