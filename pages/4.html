                <h1>Crazy 8</h1>
                <a class="pdfdocument" href="../files/HMW_Snow_Khavan.pdf">Crazy 8 Scans</a>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A variety of suggestions have been made that are pretty helpful and informative and can be directly translated into low fidelity wireframes. It has been suggested to have illustrations and iconography for the app sections that can be made in a square with a two column layouts. These could have illustrations or graph as an image relating to the subject. A variety of people included some very helpful concepts, such as including a last run screen or an overview map. When using the app, an interesting feature would be to indicate where the center of gravity is on the board. An interesting suggestion discusses the use of swiping for more detailed stats. A button can be clicked to go into more detail of the run, or even with the expanding gesture to open up a new page that would allow for more detailed analysis. This device automatically records every run. and would somehow store it. Potentially on the cloud, with most recent data being on the device. Another suggestion that is super cool would be a map view, indicating where you've been. Another way to scroll through past rides. It might even have a heatmap indicating more frequented spots. It is important to note that using the app and using the AR device will never really be used at the same time. The app would be mainly used for customization and review. While the AR device will mainly be used for performance. A future possible feature is AR streaming, where boarders can stream their performance online, similar to gamers streaming on twitch. Most snowboarders always wear goggles when going down the mountain. Goggles mainly help with visibility issues and heavy wind or fast speeds.</p>
                <h3>Instructor Mode</h3>
                <p>I have realized that using it on the mountain with instructor mode may be overwhelming. It may be very difficult to concentrate when using instructor mode and should only be available under specific conditions. A lot of beginner snowboarding is done with the help of someone holding you or applying pressure to certain places. Doing it alone a big hill can be scary. And so the app should analyze slopes and indicate which ones are safe to try on at the moment. A great suggestion is the inclusion of a ghost rider that would show the user how to do certain skills. The ghost can act as a normal instructor and talk and give tips on your riding. It can even display your own performance to show you how to improve.</p>
                <h3>Game Mode</h3>
                <p>Game mode is more of a feature that can be set and would be present through all of your data. It passively counts all of the combos and updates you on the total points and how many things you have. And would track and combine with the statistics of the runs. A leaderboard would be a great motivational and social aspect. This feature was recommended in one crazy eight. Individual Profiles is also another recommendation where you can browse people stats or information. The leaderboard can also be off that specific hill or route</p>
                <h3>Assessment of the Workshop</h3>
                <p>The crazy 8 is useful in helping me initialize my thoughts on the layout and the navigation system. There's still a lot of kinks that I need to work out but overall, these can be used straight into the low fidelity wireframes. It initializes the navigation and the layout of the project, providing some boards and designs that can include some interesting architecture. It is also important to note that the AR device is used during snowboarding. For some reason, people thought this was some kind of VR game you do at home. This is designed to be a fully usable device on the mountains. Furthermore, I want to design without concern for what is currently possible and include features geared towards enhancing the experience. </p>
