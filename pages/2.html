                <h1>Concept &#35;1 Snowboarding AR</h1>
                <h2>September 14, 2019 11:25pm</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>AR in snowboarding goggles that gives a variety of information describing a variety of information and sometimes instructional components as well as geographical and media related content. This information is used to enrich and gamify the snowboarder without too much clutter and and accompanying offlinable app. I wanted to do it for specifically snoboarding because I am an instructor and know and have access to resources for teaching it.</p>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>Both new and experience snowboardes. Different features, such as physical andle and flex data will appeal to the latter, while instructional data will appeal to the former. Gamification and path data can appeal to both.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What does a snowboarder need to know?</li>
                    <li>What forms of snowboarding are there that can use this application?</li>
                    <li>What can AR do to augment the experience?</li>
                    <li>Where would this technology be used?</li>
                    <li>How would a user want to interact with this technology?</li>
                    <li>How do people learn Snowboarding and improve on it</li>
                    <li>Who creates and hosts the data? and how would the user contribute to the data?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Initial Concept Notes</h3>
                <h4>Interface</h4>
                <p>Can contain a variety of interfaces across multiple mediums and devices</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goggles are the main informational display and will be what the user sees the most</li>
                    <li>Phone app allows for on the go editing of what is displayed and more detailed tracking of data</li>
                    <li>Possibly a desktop app or web application. This would be similar to google analytics or a performance tracker, Jefit is an example of this. Can possible review routes and look at how and where you traveled. Similar to Ace Combat mission debriefing or nike run app.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>The interface is likely to have progressive disclosure </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There should be an ability to change what is displayed and the information relevant to the person using it. This should be done with full customization but also on the fly with general learning conventions. The board should be able to slightly access skill level and demonstrate information relevant to the user</li>
                    <li>There will be a no interface mode, where data is still being tracked and maybe key landmarks are shown in proximity (or caution or danger) in order to provide a comfortable experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The goggles would have a screen displayed on the lenses. It may be the entire helmet or just the goggles</li>
                    <li>However, the goggles displays the visuals but it would make more sense if the board collects the data as it would take into account force sensors, tilt sensore, elevation, angle all based on your feet with compensation of what you can see in your eyes.</li>
                    <li>There might be an option to incorporate drones so that you can see yourself in third person or create videos on the fly. Where drone technology can be used to track the boarder.</li>
                    <li>There will be a camera and a variety of sensors to track data around</li>
                    <li>For calls and voice commands there would be a speaker and microphone</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It'll be extremely cool if a user can take a picture or video using voice and upload it right away while snowboarding.</li>
                        <li>This also relates to a music library and music selection that can be fed from a network or the phone.</li>
                        <li>Music would lead to the possibility of noise cancelation and various levels of it</li>
                        <li>With volume and these controls, then there should be an adjustable physical interface on the goggles or board to interact with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>With alpine snowboarding, you would get to places where you can't connect to a network and therefore should have an offline function and maybe a short range waki takie function if people are going out in the wild together. I can check Military Applications of this type of communication.</li>
                    <li>sShould be a platform to practice balance and coordination at home.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Data</h4>
               
                    <p>This tech would host a lot of data that is not always presented to the user but can be used to provide short tips or hints at key moments of a user experience.</p>

                        <li>These maps would include, topographic data, elevation data, landform data, Biome Data</li>
                        <li>a user can load content of where they are going to go and somehow sync it with no network?</li>

                <p>This video is about extreme winter sports and takes place in really tall mountains. It shows a very clean UI, mainly indicate points and only have the UI when necessary. It's prety neat and well designed and can be pretty useful for this project. On their routes, they have their route line with beats to indicate speed.</p>

                <h1>Concept &#35;2 Flying Cars</h1>
                <h2>September 14, 2019 11:25pm</h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The physical and the visual interface of speculative consumer grade flying vehicles in a society filled with flying vehicles. If this is too speculative, then maybe I can look at designing an architecture and system for automated cars. The consumer level side and the corporate side as well.</p>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>Drivers of Cars. The Everyday consumer. A wide range of people as this would be a consumer and civilian vehicle.</p>
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>What will the laws be in the future society of flying cars?</li>
                    <li>What forms of snowboarding are there that can use this application?</li>
                    <li>What can AR do to augment the experience?</li>
                    <li>How similar would this be to normal land based cars?</li>
                    <li>How would a user want to interact with this technology?</li>
                    <li>Would this system mainly be automated or driven by drivers</li>
                    <li>How would flying highways work? Would they just see the lines through AR?</li>
                    <li>What kind of mechanisms will be used in order to fly a vehicle? Can it hover? Are they like jets where they can't stop? Will there be a limit to the altitude the aircraft can fly at?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Initial Concept Notes</h3>
                <h4>Interface</h4>
                <p>This interface would be both digital and physical</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>building a navigation system, choosing what information to display. Emergency controls.</li>
                    <li>Research into what airplane controls use</li>
                    <li>What if we had personal flying vehicles pfv</li>
                    <li>drone interfaces - will these vehicles be controlled by AI? </li>
                    <li>Military application - How do military planes make a user interface? What can we learn from them</li>
                    <li>Fail safe interfaces - An emphasis on understanding an safety</li>
                    <li>Night vision, heat aignature, elevation models.</li>
                    <li>Weather compensation - cloud cover can be quite intense</li>
                    <li>Car dashboard interfaces</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>The interface is likely to have progressive disclosure </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There should be an ability to change what is displayed and the information relevant to the person using it. This should be done with full customization but also on the fly with general learning conventions. The board should be able to slightly access skill level and demonstrate information relevant to the user</li>
                    <li>The interface would likely show warning signs only when it occurs</li>
                    <li>Most of the system will probably be automated</li>
                </ul>
                

                <h3>Cross Media</h3>
                <p>Flying cars has been speculated for a long time. Even in the 1980's where they can be found in Blade Runner. Total Recall and Minority reports show different variations of flying vehicles or hover c</p>
